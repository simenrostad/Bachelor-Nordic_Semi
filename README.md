We are working on a bachelor assignment under the guidance of Nordic Semiconductor to make a energy harvesting stop button using the NRF52 SoC and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

The assignment is split in to two pieces, hardware and software.

The Harware part consists of the folowing:
 - Finding a Energy source
 - design the circuit and energy storage
 - energy budget
 - power managment divices
 - whireless conectivity an antanna choise (tuning antanna)
 - mecanical consrutciton
 - producing an d makong the working prototype
 - prining casing and buttons
  
  
  The software part vill consist of the folowing:
  - code for the sentral
  - code for ralayer
  - complete syystem conmunication
  - code fore button becon
  - optimising things
