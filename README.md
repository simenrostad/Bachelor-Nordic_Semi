Energy Harvesting Stop Button (EHSB)

The group consists of:
Jonathan Lange Lundaas
Besart Olluri
Tor André Melheim
Simen Rømo
Simon S. Røstad

We are working on a bachelor assignment under the guidance of Nordic Semiconductor to make a energy harvesting stop button using the NRF52832 SoC and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

The assignment is split in to two pieces, hardware and software.

The Harware part consists of the folowing:
 - Finding a Energy source
 - design the circuit and energy storage
 - energy budget
 - power managment divices
 - whireless conectivity an antanna choise (tuning antanna)
 - mecanical consrutciton
 - producing an d makong the working prototype
 - prining casing and buttons
  
  
  The software part consist of the following:
  - Firmware code for the central, relayer and stop button beacon units
  - Complete system communications
  - System optimization

  The goal was to make shure that the energy harvested would be enhuf to power the nrf52 SoC.
